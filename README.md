### Description

Forager is an application dedicated to tracking your own personal foraging locations.  
You can choose between different berries :strawberry: and mushrooms :mushroom: in the UI.

### Usage

Whenever you tap or click on the map that forage will be saved to a Firestore database, thus persisting it for you to know the location next time you visit the application.
Don't worry, only the person responsible for adding a forage will be able to see it's location, No peeking of other users locations allowed :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
